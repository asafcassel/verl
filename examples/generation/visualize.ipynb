      "Q: Eight students from a university are preparing to carpool for a trip. There are two students from each grade level—freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors—divided into two cars, Car A and Car B, with each car seating four students. The seating arrangement of the four students in the same car is not considered. However, the twin sisters, who are freshmen, must ride in the same car. The number of ways for Car A to have exactly two students from the same grade is _______. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n",
      "A: 24\n",
      "Pred: First, let's break down the problem. We have eight students from four grade levels: freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. There are two students from each grade level. The twin sisters, who are freshmen, must ride in the same car. We need to find the number of ways for Car A to have exactly two students from the same grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify the possible scenarios for Car A:**\n",
      "   - The twin sisters (both freshmen) are in Car A.\n",
      "   - There are two more freshmen in Car A.\n",
      "   - There are two more sophomores, juniors, or seniors in Car A.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Calculate the number of ways for Car A to have exactly two students from the same grade:**\n",
      "   - **Case 1:** The twin sisters are in Car A. This leaves us with 6 students (2 sophomores, 2 juniors, and 2 seniors). We need to choose 2 more students from these 6 students, and they must be from the same grade. There are 3 grades (sophomores, juniors, seniors), and for each grade, there are \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) way to choose 2 students. So, there are \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) ways to choose the remaining 2 students from the same grade.\n",
      "   - **Case 2:** There are two more freshmen in Car A. This leaves us with 6 students (2 sophomores, 2 juniors, and 2 seniors). We need to choose 2 more students from these 6 students, and they must be from the same grade. There are 3 grades (sophomores, juniors, seniors), and for each grade, there are \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) way to choose 2 students. So, there are \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) ways to choose the remaining 2 students from the same grade.\n",
      "   - **Case 3:** There are two more sophomores, two more juniors, or two more seniors in Car A. For each grade, there are \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) way to choose 2 students. Since there are 3 grades, there are \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) ways for this case.\n",
